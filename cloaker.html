      <h1>Cloaker</h1>
      <p>Cloaking is a technique used to make a website appear different to search engine crawlers and human visitors. It can be used to display different content to different users, or to hide content from search engine crawlers. There are various cloaking methods, including IP cloaking, user-agent cloaking, and referrer cloaking.</p>
      <p>Using cloaking on your website can provide several benefits, including increased search engine visibility, better user experience, and protection from competitors. However, cloaking can also be risky if not implemented correctly, as it can result in penalties from search engines or even legal action.</p>
      <h2>Types of Cloaking</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>IP cloaking:</strong> This method involves displaying different content to users based on their IP address.</li>
        <li><strong>User-agent cloaking:</strong> This method involves displaying different content to users based on their web browser or device.</li>
        <li><strong>Referrer cloaking:</strong> This method involves displaying different content to users based on their referral source (i.e., where they came from).</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Setting Up Cloaking</h2>
      <p>Setting up cloaking on your website can be done through your web server or through a third-party cloaking provider. Consult the documentation for your web server or cloaking provider for specific instructions on how to set up cloaking.</p>
